          <p>Hello! My name is John Meadows Jr, never have I ever been able to explain myself very well, but lets give it a go! My road to becoming a software
            developer didn't really start as you would expect it to. In fact, months before I even realized this was something I wanted to look into I was going
            Kent State University for marketing. After taking some a semeter off of school, basically giving myself an extra long summer break, I had found myself building
            gaming PCs. I had built myself one with a buddy of mine, who was just as clueless as I was, we had both built our very own computers from the ground up!
            All because a local electronics store was have a once in lifetime deal on a very exspensive processor. Building the computers had only taken us the weekend to do
            and with our intrest in streaming PC games, it didn't take long for us to play around with them. Shortly following, my buddy had this idea, that we would build
            a gaming PC for another one of our friends for his birthday! The catch to us actually doing it though, was if he helped build it with us so that he can learn himself
            as well. Also, it gets exspensive, so we wanted him to be invested first. The proccess itself was a rather boring one as expected but he was happy none the less. It wasn't
            until I had done almost the exact same thing for my little cousin, to take that step back and say "Huh, this is kind of fun". Afterwards, my girlfriend at the time had
            encouraged me to maybe start looking around into schooling surrounded by computers. My first thought was coding! I had seen it around a time or two and it had always caught
            eye, so upon suggestion I was all in. I looked around on the internet for a few days, looking at course at University's and degree requirements and it made me start to
            feel a little nervous. I then struck gold! I found a 6 month coding bootcamp, hosted by Case Western Reserve University. I immediatly took action and began piecing
            my things together, starting my journey to becoming a software developer!
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>If you're curious as to what build I might have or intrested in building one of your own, leave your email for me in my contact page! P.S. I actually do stream occasionally on twitch!
            GrimGGames is my handle, drop a follow for support, stay and hangout if your interested.
